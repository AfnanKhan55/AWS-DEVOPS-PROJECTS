In today’s fast-paced DevOps world, manual deployments are obsolete! 🚀 This project focuses on end-to-end automation of Dockerized applications using:⁣
🔹 GitHub for source code management⁣
🔹 AWS CodePipeline for automated CI/CD⁣
🔹 Docker & Amazon ECS for seamless containerized deployments⁣
⁣
With this powerful integration, every commit to the repository automatically triggers a build, pushes the Docker image to AWS ECR, and deploys the latest version to ECS – ensuring zero-downtime releases! 🚀⁣
