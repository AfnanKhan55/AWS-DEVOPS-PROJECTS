🔹 Key Skills & Accomplishments:⁣⁣
✅ Version Control & Webhooks – Configured GitHub webhooks to trigger automated builds upon code commits.⁣⁣
✅ AWS CodeBuild Setup – Created a build pipeline in AWS CodeBuild to compile, test, and containerize applications.⁣⁣
✅ Docker Image Automation – Used Docker to package applications for seamless deployment across cloud environments.⁣⁣
✅ AWS ECR Integration – Pushed Docker images to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for scalable cloud storage.⁣⁣
✅ Automated Testing & Deployment – Configured buildspec.yml to validate builds before deployment.⁣⁣
✅ Monitoring & Notifications – Integrated AWS CloudWatch Logs and SNS alerts for real-time build tracking.⁣⁣
