⁣
💡 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐦?⁣
Docker Swarm transforms multiple Docker hosts into a single cluster, enabling auto-scaling, load balancing, and high availability—all while using the familiar Docker CLI!⁣
⁣
🔹 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐀𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 & 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:⁣
✅ EC2 Cluster Setup – Launched & configured multiple AWS EC2 instances for a multi-node Swarm setup.⁣
✅ Swarm Initialization & Worker Nodes – Created a Swarm manager and added worker nodes for distributed orchestration.⁣
✅ Service Deployment & Scaling – Deployed Nginx across the cluster and scaled it dynamically.⁣
✅ Load Balancing & Fault Tolerance – Ensured auto-recovery of failed containers and efficient traffic distribution.⁣
✅ Integration with AWS Services – Utilized EBS for persistent storage and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for traffic routing.⁣
⁣
🔧 Troubleshooting: Worker Nodes Not Connecting?⁣
⚠️ Issue: Worker nodes failed to join the Swarm due to network issues.⁣
✅ Fix: Ensured ports 2377, 7946, and 4789 were open for Swarm communication.⁣
