Cloud-Native Containerization – Building & Deploying Docker Images to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)🚀⁣
⁣
🔍 Mastering Cloud-Based Container Image Management!⁣
This project focused on understanding the end-to-end process of creating a Docker image and pushing it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR). This is a key skill for DevOps, Cloud Computing, and Microservices Deployment.⁣
⁣
🔹 Key Skills and Accomplishments:⁣
🔹 Docker Installation & Setup: Installed and configured Docker to containerize applications efficiently.⁣
🔹 Creating a Dockerfile: Defined a Dockerfile to containerize an application using Nginx as the base image.⁣
🔹 Building a Docker Image: Used docker build -t my-app . to create a containerized application.⁣
🔹 AWS ECR Authentication: Successfully authenticated to AWS ECR using the AWS CLI.⁣
🔹 Creating & Tagging an ECR Repository: Created an AWS ECR repository and tagged the image with the repository URL.⁣
🔹 Pushing an Image to AWS ECR: Used docker push to store the Docker image in AWS Elastic Container Registry for future deployment.⁣
🔹 Verifying Deployment: Checked and confirmed that the Docker image was successfully stored in AWS ECR.⁣
