💡 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐀𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:⁣
✅ Automated Docker Image Management – No more manual docker pull commands! The script ensures the latest Nginx image is fetched automatically.⁣
✅ Effortless Container Deployment – With a single script execution, the Docker container is up and running on AWS, ready to serve traffic.⁣
✅ Error Handling & Validation – Implemented fail-safe checks to verify if the image pulls successfully and the container launches correctly.⁣
✅ AWS Integration – Built a lightweight automation layer for deploying Dockerized workloads in the cloud.⁣
