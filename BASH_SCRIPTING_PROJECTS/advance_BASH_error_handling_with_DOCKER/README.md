🔹 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 & 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:⁣
✅ Error Detection for Docker Failures – The script identifies failed Docker container executions and provides immediate feedback.⁣
✅ Graceful Error Handling – Instead of stopping abruptly, the script catches errors and suggests corrective actions.⁣
✅ Enhanced Debugging & Logging – The script logs failures, helping in troubleshooting issues efficiently.⁣
✅ Improved Script Reliability – Ensures Bash scripts are robust, resilient, and production-ready.⁣
✅ Essential for AWS & Cloud Environments – Ideal for automating error-resistant container deployments in cloud infrastructures.⁣
