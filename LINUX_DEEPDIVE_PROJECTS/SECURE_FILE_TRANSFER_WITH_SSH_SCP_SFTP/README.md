Mastering Secure File Transfer with SSH, SCP, and SFTP! 🚀

🔍 Ensuring Data Integrity and Confidentiality During File Transfers!
This project focused on implementing secure file transfer techniques, empowering me to use SSH for secure remote shell access, transfer files securely using SCP and SFTP, and manage SSH keys for passwordless authentication. Key skills and accomplishments include:

🔐 SSH for Secure Remote Shell Access:
Connected securely to remote systems using SSH (ssh username@remote_ip) and executed remote commands seamlessly.

📁 Secure File Transfer with SCP and SFTP:
Transferred files securely between systems using SCP:
Local to Remote: scp local_file.txt username@remote_ip:/path/to/destination
Remote to Local: scp username@remote_ip:/path/to/remote_file /local/destination
Established SFTP sessions (sftp username@remote_ip) to upload (put) and download (get) files securely.

🔑 SSH Key Management for Passwordless Authentication:
Generated SSH key pairs using ssh-keygen -t rsa and enabled passwordless authentication by copying public keys to remote systems using ssh-copy-id.
🔥 Why This Matters:
Mastering secure file transfer techniques ensures data integrity and confidentiality during network operations, which is crucial for system administrators, network engineers, and DevOps professionals.
