🔍 Building a Foundation for Next-Gen Network Connectivity!
This project focused on mastering the essential skills for configuring, testing, and troubleshooting IPv6 networks in Linux. These skills are crucial for ensuring seamless communication in modern, IPv6-enabled environments. Key skills and accomplishments include:

🔹 𝗜𝗣𝘃𝟲 𝗔𝗱𝗱𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Configured IPv6 addresses on network interfaces using ip -6 addr add, enabling systems to communicate effectively over IPv6 networks.
🔹 /𝗲𝘁𝗰/𝗵𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗜𝗣𝘃𝟲: Successfully edited /etc/hosts to map hostnames to IPv6 addresses, facilitating internal network communication and testing using IPv6.
🔹 𝗜𝗣𝘃𝟲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Utilized ping6 to test connectivity to remote IPv6 hosts, ensuring proper network reachability.
🔹 𝗜𝗣𝘃𝟲 𝗥𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀: Analyzed the IPv6 routing table using ip -6 route show to understand traffic flow and identify potential routing issues.
🔹 𝗜𝗣𝘃𝟲 𝗧𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Employed tracepath6 to diagnose and troubleshoot IPv6 connectivity problems, pinpointing network bottlenecks and identifying path issues.
