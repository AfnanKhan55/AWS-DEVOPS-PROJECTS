Shell Command Proficiency
Mastering the command line is a must-have skill for any tech professional! This hands-on lab strengthened my ability to navigate Unix/Linux systems, automate tasks, and manage files efficientlyâ€”all through the power of shell commands.
Key Takeaways from the Lab:
âœ… Mastered essential shell commands like ls, cd, pwd, cp, mv, rm, and mkdir.
 âœ… Explored input-output redirection, including > (overwrite), >> (append), and | (piping).
 âœ… Implemented error redirection (2>) to log errors for debugging.
 âœ… Created simple bash scripts for automating tasks like directory backups.
ðŸ’¡ Why does this matter?
 Shell scripting and command-line proficiency are crucial for system administration, DevOps, and automation. Efficiently handling tasks via the terminal saves time, improves workflows, and boosts productivity.
This is just one step in my journey toward mastering system automation and cloud computingâ€”excited for whatâ€™s next!
