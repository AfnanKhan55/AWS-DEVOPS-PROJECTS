Mastering File Compression and Archiving in Linux! 🚀

🔍 Optimizing Data Storage and Transfer through Efficient Compression and Archiving!
This lab focused on mastering essential file compression and archiving techniques, enabling me to efficiently manage data storage and transfer in a Linux environment. Key skills and accomplishments include:

🔹 gzip and bzip2 Compression: Hands-on experience compressing and decompressing files using:
sudo gzip example.txt – Compressed a file with gzip.
sudo gzip -d example.txt.gz – Decompressed a gzip file.
sudo bzip2 example.txt – Compressed a file with bzip2.
sudo bzip2 -d example.txt.bz2 – Decompressed a bzip2 file.

🔹 Tar Archiving and Management: Mastered creating, extracting, listing, and updating tar archives:
sudo tar -cvf archive.tar file1.txt file2.txt directory1 – Created a tar archive.
sudo tar -xvf archive.tar – Extracted files from a tar archive.
sudo tar -tvf archive.tar – Listed contents of a tar archive.
sudo tar -uvf archive.tar new_file.txt – Updated an existing tar archive.

🔹 Combining Archiving and Compression: Efficiently combined archiving with compression for better data management:
sudo tar -czvf archive.tar.gz file1.txt file2.txt directory1 – Created a gzip-compressed tarball.
sudo tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz – Extracted files from a compressed tar archive.
