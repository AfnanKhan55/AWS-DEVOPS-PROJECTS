Mastering System Monitoring and Logging! 🚀

🔍 Getting Insightful with Logs and Proactive with Alerts!
 This project took me on an in-depth journey into System Monitoring and Logging, equipping me with essential skills to:
📁 Locate and Interpret System Log Files and Journals: Viewing System Logs using syslog, exploring Systemd Journals with journalctl, and filtering journals by specific units like sshd.

🔄 Preserve System Journals Across Reboots: Configuring Persistent Journals to retain valuable log data even after system restarts and verifying persistent journals with list-boots.

📊 Set Up and Configure Basic System Monitoring and Alerting: Installing powerful monitoring tools like htop and iftop for real-time system resource monitoring and detailed network traffic analysis.

⚠️ Setting Up Alerts for Proactive Monitoring: Creating a Bash script to detect and alert on high CPU usage and making the script executable for seamless automation.

⏰ Automating Alerts with Cron Jobs: Scheduling the script to run every 5 minutes using crontab—ensuring proactive monitoring 24/7!
