 Mastering File Permissions and Documentation! 📚

💻 Taking Command of Security and Knowledge! 💻
In this project, I explored the core of Linux security and documentation, gaining expertise in:
✅ File Permission Management—Listing, setting, and changing ugo/rwx permissions for total control.
🔍 Diagnosing and correcting file permission issues—Because security starts at the file level!
📖 Navigating system documentation using man pages, info pages, and exploring /usr/share/doc—Unlocking the treasure trove of knowledge.
🔥 Why This Matters:
Secure file permissions safeguard sensitive data and ensure system integrity.
Efficient use of documentation saves time and enhances problem-solving.
These skills are essential for System Administration and DevOps Security.
🚀 Level Up:
This project sharpened my ability to secure systems and leverage documentation for faster debugging and smarter administration.
