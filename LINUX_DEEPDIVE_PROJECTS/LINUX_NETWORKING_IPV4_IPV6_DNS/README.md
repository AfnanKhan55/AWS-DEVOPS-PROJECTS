Mastering Basic Linux Networking: IPv4/IPv6, DNS, & Service Management! üöÄ

üîç Building a Foundation for Reliable Network Communication and Service Availability!
This project focused on mastering fundamental Linux networking skills, empowering me to configure and manage network interfaces, ensure proper hostname resolution, and control service startup behavior. Key skills and accomplishments include:

IPv4/IPv6 Configuration: Hands-on experience configuring IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on network interfaces using ip addr add, enabling systems to communicate effectively on both IP versions.

/etc/hosts Management: Successfully edited /etc/hosts to map hostnames to IP addresses, facilitating internal network communication and testing.
DNS Configuration: Configured DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf to enable reliable resolution of external domain names.

Service Management with systemctl: Proficient in managing network services using systemctl, including viewing service status (systemctl status), enabling autostart (systemctl enable), and disabling autostart (systemctl disable).

Verification skills: Ensured that changes were properly made by verifying that network communication occurred through IPv4/IPv6,DNS and that networking started after each reboot.
