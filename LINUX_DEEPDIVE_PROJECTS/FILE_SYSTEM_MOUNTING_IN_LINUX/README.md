Mastering Filesystem Mounting in Linux! 🚀
🔍 Building a Foundation for Efficient Filesystem Management and Troubleshooting!
 This project focused on mastering the essential skills of mounting and unmounting filesystems in Linux, configuring automatic mounts, and diagnosing common filesystem issues. These abilities are crucial for managing data storage and ensuring system stability. Key skills and accomplishments include:

🔹 Manual Mounting and Unmounting: Gained hands-on experience in manually mounting filesystems using sudo mount device mount_point and unmounting them with sudo umount mount_point. This provided a deeper understanding of how filesystems are integrated and detached from the system.

🔹 Automated Mounting with /etc/fstab: Configured /etc/fstab to enable automatic mounting of filesystems at boot. Tested configurations using sudo mount -a to ensure error-free entries, enhancing system efficiency and reducing manual tasks.

🔹 Filesystem Diagnosis and Troubleshooting: Utilized powerful commands like:
sudo mount -v -o remount,ro /: To check for syntax errors in /etc/fstab.
df -h: To check currently mounted filesystems and their usage.
cat /proc/mounts: To verify active mount points and troubleshoot mounting issues.
