Full-Stack 3-Tier App Deployment on AWS – Scalable & Cloud-Native! 🌍☁️
💡 What if you could deploy a full-stack application seamlessly in the cloud? In this project, I worked on an open-source 3-tier web application with React (frontend), Node.js (backend), and MongoDB (database)—handling the DevOps workflow and deploying it on AWS EC2 for a production-ready cloud setup! 🚀

🔹 Key Features & Implementation:
✅ React Frontend for a Smooth UI – Built a dynamic and responsive user interface with React for seamless user experience.
✅ Node.js Backend for API Handling – Developed an efficient Express.js server to handle business logic and API requests.
✅ MongoDB for Scalable Data Storage – Implemented NoSQL database architecture for high performance and scalability.
✅ AWS EC2 Deployment with DevOps Best Practices – Deployed the app on AWS EC2, ensuring a secure, scalable, and optimized cloud environment.
✅ CI/CD for Automated Deployments – Integrated GitHub Actions & AWS CLI for seamless code updates and infrastructure management.
